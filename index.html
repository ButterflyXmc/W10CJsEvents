       <h2>Shikuwasa (Citrus Fruit)</h2>
       <p id="ptag">These little fruits are native to Taiwan and Okinawa. They are used as a flavoring for many local dishes, 
        and also lend themselves well to juices, jams, dressings, or as a garnish.</p>

        <h2>Hatsukoi no Kaori Ichigo / (White) Strawberry</h2>
        <p id="ptag">This is the newest of Japan's strawberry fruit varieties. The name means 'scent of first love', 
            and it is arguably the most expensive strawberry in the world. It looks and tastes like an ordinary 
            strawberry, except the flesh is pure white. </p>

    <div id="box3">
        <h2>Akebia</h2>
        <p id="ptag">Akebia are native to China, Korea, Taiwan and Japan. They are also considered to be an invasive species 
            in New Zealand, where they were accidentally introduced. It's actually quite a versatile plant: the plants 
            can be used to make tea or for weaving baskets, while the edible fruits can be eaten like a vegetable. </p>
